# Weather-Application

In this application, the purpose is to provide the user whom may be a traveler with the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that the user can plan their trip accordingly.

Third party APIs were used to access their functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This application utilized the third party OpenWeather API. The application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

When searched for a city, current and future forecast and condtions are presented. Modern images of weather conditions are presented to the user. Conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index are presented. The UV index is dynamic, as different colors will show depending on the severity of the city's UV index. This application also save the user's search history to be easily access if the user desires to access a previously searched city.

I hope you enjoy my application!
